Needs Analysis:

Tone Recognition (Reading) **MVP**
- Covers all tone combinations for each consonant class (high, mid, low), live/dead, and long/short syllables.
- Displays a Thai word and asks for tone identification based solely on script rules.
- Uses a chart database that follows the Thai tone rules for automated generation and validation of practice questions.
- Provides instant, AI-powered feedback.

Word Recognition (Reading)
- The system shows Thai words and prompts for English meaning selection.
- Additionally, test on Thai numbers as well
- The module can pull dictionary entries and high-frequency vocabulary.
- Have the AI highlight and drill exceptional words—ones that don't obey typical Thai script conventions and must be memorized individually, like อาหาร (food) 

Translation (Writing)
- Presents an English word and requests the user to write the correct Thai equivalent in the script.
- AI checks spelling, tone marks, consonant class accuracy, and gives immediate feedback.

Listening Comprehension (Writing)
- Plays a native Thai reading of a word/syllable and asks for the written Thai script.

Rule Discovery (AI-Powered)
AI can be set to periodically scour reputable web sources and teaching materials for new or unusual Thai writing rules, such as the special usages of รร (which often acts as a vowel and changes pronunciation), and surface a "new rule" for practice in each session. 

Extract Sentences from Authentic Materials
Include a feature where the system picks sentences from books, news, or passages (leveraging Thai reader datasets or web scraping). This gives exposure to real-world Thai usage, context, and writing styles, ensuring your reading practice is relevant and varied.
